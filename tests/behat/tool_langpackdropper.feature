Feature: The language pack dropper tool allows admins to use non-AMOS language packs easily
  In order to customize my Moodle installation
  As an admin

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |

# This Scenario is currently commented out as it fails on the last step - The user still sees "Mitglieder" while it should say "Personen".
# The reasons for this failure are unknown as everything works fine when the plugin is tested manually.

#  Scenario: Configure a new (top level structured) language pack in the plugin settings, have it downloaded with the ad-hoc task and have it updated later with the scheduled task
